#React Typescript Tailwind Bible
I'm trying to dip my toes into frontend development, and by doing so, this is the stack that I want to start out with.

After doing quite a bit of research, I have come to the realization that React, Typescript and Tailwind will be my stack of choice.

##Usage
To create a React Typescript project, go into an empty directory and do `create-react-app --template typescript`

##Reasoning
###React
I chose react primarily because it has a very strong community and it scales well with larger applications while being simple to pick up. It is also free and open source which is a big plus.

###Typescript
The usefulness of typescript cannot be understated. It can prevent a large portion of bugs from making it into production especially as the size of projects scale. 

###Tailwind
Tailwind is a great CSS solution because it is easy to learn, it combines well with React and other JS frameworks, and it is highly customizable.
